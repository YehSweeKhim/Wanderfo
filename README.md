Head over to our [proposal](/Wanderfo%20Proposal.pdf) to find out more about Wanderfo.

## Problem
During a pandemic, a common problem that people faced was the closure of several businesses, be it F&B and other services. And the general public may be unaware of the closure of the shops/ services that are affected. This causes inconvenience to the general public since they have to physically visit the shops/ services or retrieve information from diverse platforms that may not be reliable to know if the shop/ service is opened. Business owners may also be unaware of the evolving pandemic situation and have to contact the relevant authorities for further clarifications on the closure of their business. This takes time and increases the workload on the relevant authorities.

## Wanderfo Framework
•	Wanderfo mobile app facilitates the flow of information (e.g. shop status) from business owners to the public.
